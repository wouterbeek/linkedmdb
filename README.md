# ðŸŽž Linked Internet Movie Database

Cleaned copy of the Linked Data version of an older extract of the
Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

This cleaned copy is used in order to be able to public this dataset
as part of [Yet Another LOD Cloud
(YALC)](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC):
https://triplydb.com/Triply/linkedmdb

## Why did we clean this dataset?

Exisiting versions of this dataset cannot be uploaded to the LOD Cloud
because they contain syntax errors:

  - https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC/blob/master/datasets/errors/README.md#unescaped-double-quote
  - https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC/blob/master/datasets/errors/README.md#unescaped-space-characters
